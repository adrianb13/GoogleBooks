#ReactGoogleBooksSearch

This app uses Mongodb, Express, React, and Node.  It allows you to search Google Books with any titles/topics you would like to read about.

The search sections allows you query any book in the Google Books library and returns the top 5 matches based on your query.

The listed results will show you the title, author, brief description, a thumbnail image of the cover (if available), a link to go purchase the book from Google Books, and a link to Save it to your own personal list.

When you click the "Saved" link in the navbar, it will present you with your Saved Books (assuming you have books saved).

When you click the "Search link in the navbar, it will return your search box so you can find more books and add them to your list.
